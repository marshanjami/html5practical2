        <h3>History of the book</h3>
        <p>
        <i>And the Mountains Echoed</i> was published in <b>2013</b> as Khaled Hosseini’s 
        third novel, following <i>The Kite Runner</i> (2003) and <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> (2007).
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike his earlier works that focused mainly on one or two characters, this book uses an 
        interconnected storytelling style, following multiple generations and locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The novel reflects Hosseini’s Afghan heritage, blending themes of family, sacrifice, 
        and migration with stories set in Afghanistan, Paris, and the United States. 
        It received positive reviews for its emotional depth and complex narrative, further 
        establishing Hosseini as an important contemporary author writing about Afghanistan.
